        "\n",
        "The \"Golden Tier\" (Top-Center): RPG has emerged as the clear winner for professional studios. With a median player count of 14.0 (the highest of any standard genre), it offers the best \"safety floor\" in the industry. Strategy remains a solid \"Core Pillar\" (Median 9.0), offering a stable, reliable audience that isn't as cutthroat as Action.\n",
        "\n",
        "The \"Blue Ocean\" (Top-Left): Massively Multiplayer remains the \"Blue Ocean.\" It has the highest demand (Median ~39) and lowest competition. However, the technical barrier to entry acts as a natural gatekeeper, meaning this is high-reward but requires significant backend expertise.\n",
        "\n",
        "The \"High-Stakes Arena\" (Right-Side): Action has graduated from a \"Graveyard\" to a \"Gladiator Arena.\" Removing indie noise reveals that professional Action games do find players (Median 10.0), but the competition is massive. It is no longer a \"Don't Enter\" zone, but it is a \"Winner-Take-All\" market requiring AAA production values.\n",
        "\n",
        "The \"Professional Trap\" (Bottom-Right): The studio must strictly avoid Adventure. Even after removing amateur indie titles, Adventure games struggle significantly (Median 5.0) while facing the highest competition levels. It is an oversaturated market where even professional games struggle to get noticed."

        "\n",
        "The Insight: This is the lowest concentration on the list. While other genres are tightening, Simulation leaves 55%+ of the market open for mid-sized developers. The giants do not suffocate the little guys here.\n",

        "The \"High Floor\" (RPG): While RPGs are top-heavy (Top 10 hold 66%), they offer the best safety net.\n",

        "The Data: The Median CCU is 14.0 (The highest of all standard genres).\n",
        "\n",
        "The Insight: Even though the giants dominate, the \"middle class\" of RPGs is wealthy. You don't need to beat the Top 10 to survive; the \"average\" outcome is still very healthy.\n",

        "The \"Gladiator Arena\" (Action):\n",

        "\"Service\" is King.\n",
        "\n",
        "For professional Non-Indie studios, a \"One-and-Done\" release (0 DLCs) is the weakest strategy. The graph confirms a powerful \"Long Tail Premium,\" where games with 10+ DLCs (Live Service model) see the highest active player counts, particularly in Strategy and Simulation genres.\n",

        "The Strategic Insight to Present:\n",
        "1. The \"Strategy\" Staircase (The Live Service Mandate)\n",
        "\n",
        "The Data: Look at the Light Green Bar (Strategy). It grows steadily with every tier, peaking massively at \"Service (10+)\".\n",
        "\n",
        "The Insight: Strategy players (like Civilization or Stellaris fans) view a game as a long-term hobby. They expect 5+ years of updates. If you launch a Strategy game without a DLC roadmap, the community will likely abandon it for a \"deeper\" competitor.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The \"Simulation\" Infinite Loop\n",
        "\n",
        "The Data: The Orange Bar (Simulation) also peaks at the highest tier.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Insight: Simulation players (like The Sims or Truck Simulator) are hungry for content. They will continuously pay for new assets (maps, vehicles, items) indefinitely. This is the most lucrative long-term model.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The \"RPG\" Quality over Quantity\n",
        "\n",
        "The Data: The Green Bar (RPG) is strong at \"Medium (3-5)\" and \"Large (6-10)\", but it doesn't necessarily need infinite updates like Strategy.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Insight: RPG players want significant expansions (new story arcs), not just small item packs. A roadmap of 3-5 major DLCs is likely the sweet spot for maximizing revenue without developer burnout.\n",
