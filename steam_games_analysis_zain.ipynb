        "\"Service\" is King.\n",
        "\n",
        "For professional Non-Indie studios, a \"One-and-Done\" release (0 DLCs) is the weakest strategy. The graph confirms a powerful \"Long Tail Premium,\" where games with 10+ DLCs (Live Service model) see the highest active player counts, particularly in Strategy and Simulation genres.\n",

        "The Strategic Insight to Present:\n",
        "1. The \"Strategy\" Staircase (The Live Service Mandate)\n",
        "\n",
        "The Data: Look at the Light Green Bar (Strategy). It grows steadily with every tier, peaking massively at \"Service (10+)\".\n",
        "\n",
        "The Insight: Strategy players (like Civilization or Stellaris fans) view a game as a long-term hobby. They expect 5+ years of updates. If you launch a Strategy game without a DLC roadmap, the community will likely abandon it for a \"deeper\" competitor.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The \"Simulation\" Infinite Loop\n",
        "\n",
        "The Data: The Orange Bar (Simulation) also peaks at the highest tier.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Insight: Simulation players (like The Sims or Truck Simulator) are hungry for content. They will continuously pay for new assets (maps, vehicles, items) indefinitely. This is the most lucrative long-term model.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The \"RPG\" Quality over Quantity\n",
        "\n",
        "The Data: The Green Bar (RPG) is strong at \"Medium (3-5)\" and \"Large (6-10)\", but it doesn't necessarily need infinite updates like Strategy.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Insight: RPG players want significant expansions (new story arcs), not just small item packs. A roadmap of 3-5 major DLCs is likely the sweet spot for maximizing revenue without developer burnout.\n",

        "Executive Summary for the Slide:\n",
        "\"Long Tail Strategy: The Roadmap to Retention\"\n",
