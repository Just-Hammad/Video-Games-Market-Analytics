Project Requirements
1. Dataset Selection (must be challenging)
• Choose a dataset that contains:
o At least 10,000 records.
o At least 5 different variables, including:
▪ Quantitative (numeric, continuous or discrete)
▪ Categorical (nominal or ordinal)
▪ Temporal (date/time)
▪ Optional: spatial or network data.
• Possible sources: Kaggle, government open data portals, WHO/UN databases, World
Bank, GitHub datasets OR any other
2. Data Preparation & Cleaning (Real Challenge)
• Perform data wrangling:
o Handle missing values using appropriate strategies.
o Detect and remove redundant or derivable attributes.
o Deal with outliers and justify treatment.
o Standardize inconsistent categories (e.g., "M", "Male", "m").
• Document before-and-after transformations (with screenshots/code snippets).
3. Data Reduction & Transformation
• Apply at least one data reduction technique:
o Aggregation (e.g., monthly averages instead of daily).
o Sampling (e.g., stratified sampling for large datasets).
o Dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA for multivariate data).
• Justify why the reduction was necessary.
4. Visualization Design & Implementation
Out of many, at least 2 visualizations must be interactive (using Tableau, Power BI, or
Python libraries like Plotly/Bokeh).
5. Ethical & Design Considerations
• Explicitly state:
o How your visualization avoids misleading representations.
o Accessibility features (colorblind-friendly palettes, readable labels).
o Ethical concerns (privacy, bias, sensitive data).
6. Deliverables
• Technical Report (15–20 pages):
o Dataset description & source.
o Detailed cleaning, wrangling, and reduction process.
o Explanation of visualization choices (why this chart, why this encoding).
o Discussion of insights and conclusions.
o Reflection on ethics and limitations.
o Overall message/ Narrative
• Final Presentation (12–15 minutes):
o Introduction of the dataset
o Demonstrate before/after cleaning.
o Walk through explanatory data analysis.
o Highlight 2–3 key insights supported by visuals.
o Present an overall message/narrative

Minor issues in
cleaning; most
justifications
provided; some
documentation
missing.
Basic cleaning
done but little
justification;
transformations
not fully clear.
Minimal effort; data left
messy; missing
justifications/documentation.
2. Data
Reduction
Techniques
15%
Applied ≥1 advanced
technique (aggregation,
sampling, PCA, etc.) with
strong justification;
demonstrated clear
improvement in dataset
usability.
Applied a
reduction
technique with
some justification;
impact partially
explained.

Portfolio includes ≥6 highquality visuals covering
required types; at least 2 are
interactive; visuals are clear,
accurate, aesthetically
pleasing, and insightful.
≥5 visuals with
moderate variety;
at least 1
interactive; some
design/clarity
issues.
